# A better setup for Git // fullweb weekly
# Git default configuration is good but it can be personalized to improve your workflow efficiency. 
# Here are some good lines to put in your ~/.gitconfig:

# The basics, who you commit as:
[user]
  name = John Doe
  email = john@doe.org

# Your Github username
[github]
  user = githubusername

# Some aliases to save 1000s keystrokes each year:
[alias]

  # Convenient for minified files

# Add colors
[color]
